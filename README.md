# TombSurvivor
A simple game where the user must juggle the artifact without dropping it. (An early prototype for a more detailed game.)
<br>
Tap and hold on the artifact to pick it up. Drag it around and swipe and release to toss it. Make sure to catch it before it falls off the screen.
<br><br>
Playable at http://james.colautti.ca/Projects/TombSurvivor/
